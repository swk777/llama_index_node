## 🚀 About The Project

The <code>llama_index</code> is a fantastic library. However, the current Python version isn't well-adapted to the JavaScript ecosystem. Thus, we need a JavaScript version.

The project is based on the <code>llama_index</code> version 0.5.5, and most of the code has been generated by ChatGPT.

Many thanks to the team behind llama_index for their excellent work.

## 🛠️ Setup

To set up the environment, rename <code>.env.example</code> to <code>.env</code> and modify the variables as needed.
